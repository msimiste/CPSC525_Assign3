Purpose: CPSC515 Assignment 3


1.  This program was created with Java version 1.8.65.
    In order to parse HTML  the Jsoup library was used. The jar files are included with the submission.

2.  All files and folders relevant to compiling and running the assignment are found within the project folders. While this is not standard practice it is
    Convenient for testing/running the pogram. 

3.  The program should open most default browsers when creating the html files. It was tested on Windows 8.1 and Linux (Gnome) and opened Firefox with no 
    issue on both systems.
